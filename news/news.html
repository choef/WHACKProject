			<i>FIFA 16</i>: Breaking Barriers in (Virtual) Sports</a></h2>
				<p>In a lovely showcase of progress, EA's new release, <i>FIFA 16</i> is the first game of its franchise to
				include the option to play as women. Acknowledging the growing popularity of women's football, especially in
				national teams, the game now gives every player the option to play as their national men's team or national women's team.
				Other similar series like <i>Pez</i>, which deals with club football and not national football, have yet to implement
				this modification, but will hopefully follow suit.</p>
