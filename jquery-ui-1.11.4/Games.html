		<h3>Life Is Strange</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>User Review: 8.6/10</li> 
			<li>Rated 7/10 on 
			<a href = "http://www.gamespot.com/life-is-strange/</li>">GameSpot</a>
			<li><b>Our Review:</b> (9/10) Such an amazing game! Great animation and engaging storyline. Heavy in plot and character development; no fighting or combat. Basically an interactive movie -- you can move the character using controls, watch cut scenes, and choose which decisions the main character (Max) makes which influences how the storyline progresses. Great for first time gamers!

			<li><b>Our Review:</b>(10/10) **OUR FAVE** INCREDIBLE game packed with well-developed characters, a heart-wrenching storyline, and decently challenging combat and battles! You (most of the time) play as Sora and fight alongside your friends, Donald and Goofy (yes, this game has a lot of Disney characters in it), to save all the worlds from the evil heartless! A well-known game with several installments and a large fanbase. A MUST-DO for first time gamers and really all gamers in general!</li>
