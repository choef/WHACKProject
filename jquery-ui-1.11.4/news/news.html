			<i>FIFA 16</i>: Breaking Barriers in (Virtual) Sports</a></h2>
				<p>In a lovely showcase of progress, EA's new release, <i>FIFA 16</i> is the first game of its franchise to
				include the option to play as women. Acknowledging the growing popularity of women's football, especially in
				national teams, the game now gives every player the option to play as their national men's team or national women's team.
				Other similar series like <i>Pez</i>, which deals with club football and not national football, have yet to implement
				this modification, but will hopefully follow suit.</p>

			Girls Who Code Wow The World Again With "Bias Breaker" Game</a></h2>
				<p>New York high school students Shazmin Mahmud (17) and Jay Pen (15), in association with Girls Who Code, have created
				<i>Bias Breaker</i>, an RPG-style game in which the player selects one of a diverse range of characters, then proceeds
				to shoot harmful stereotypes (represented as blobs). Who hasn't wanted to kill stereotypes?</p>

			E3 Delivers Some Badass Women</a></h2>
				<p>E3 is the biggest gaming event of the year, where triple-A games are announced and demos are shown to a worldwide
				audience as a promise of what's to come. So how did the big releases do on female characters this years? According to
				<i>The Mary Sue</i>, not bad at all. They've compiled a list of 23 games featuring kick-ass playable female characters,
				including titles like <i>Mass Effect: Andromeda</i> (in which you can choose to play as male or female), <i>Rise of the
				Tomb Raider</i> (featuring the much beloved Lara Croft), <i>Michonne</i> (a spin-off of the highly successful <i>The Walking
				Dead Game</i>, focused on the story of female character Michonne), and <i>Fable Legends</i> (part of the popular <i>Fable</i>
				series and featuring multiple playable female characters).</p>

				<p>This year's Game Developer's Conference in March featured a wonderful panel on the participation of women in eSports,
				an area you could almos say is more overwhelmingly male than the rest of the gaming industry. Some of the speakers include
				Heather Mumm, Rachel Quirico, and Kim Phan. Stigmas, social pressures and the current environment are all discussed by women
				prominent in gaming. Curious about women in eSports? <a href="http://www.esportsearnings.com/players/female_players">Check outline
