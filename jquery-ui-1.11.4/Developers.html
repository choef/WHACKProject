	<h1>Learn about the ladies behind your favorite game!</h1>
	<p>The average American gamer is 31 years old and 48% are female, which is up from 40 percent in 2010. Women age 18 or older represent a significantly greater portion of the game-playing population (36%) than boys age 18 or younger (17%).

		<br>
		According to a recent survey conducted by the International Game Developers Association (IGDA), the number of women working in the game industry has doubled since 2009 to 22% of the workforce. But it's still a man's world: 76% of game developers are men.</p>

		<img src="pictures/RobinHunicke.jpg" alt="Robin Hunicke" style="width:350px;height:200px;">
		<p>Game designer, producer, and developer Robin Hunicke served as executive producer on the award-winning game "Journey" and is the co-founder and CEO of video game studio Funomena. Hunicke's experimental games focus on ideas and feelings not often explored in video games, like one's personal connection to other players, the nature of time, and even what it feels like to be a flower petal carried by the wind. Her next game, announced last December, is being developed in collaboration with "Katamari Damacy" creator Keita Takahashi for the PlayStation 4. The game, called "Wattam," explores a world in which toys come to life.

		<h3>Amy Robinson</h3>
		<img src="pictures/AmyRobinson.jpg" alt="AmyRobinson" style="width:350px;height:200px;">
		<p>Robinson is not a traditional game designer, per se. She's the executive director of EyeWire, a crowdsourcing science game made in collaboration with Princeton University, currently played by some 175,000 people around the world. The aim is to map neurons in the brain, a time-consuming activity that would normally take more time and resources than are available: according to Robinson, it currently takes around 50 hours to map a single neuron in the brain. Now, with the help of a 3D puzzle game available online for free to anyone who wants to play, gamers are helping neuroscientists chart synaptic connections. EyeWire launched a few years ago and is now played by gamers in over 160 countries. “It's everyone, from students to grandmothers,” Robinson said in a talk at this year's GDC conference. “Our top player is a bus driver from Egypt.” Robinson's team is now entirely focused on making other video games with the aim of crowdsourcing different scientific problems. “There are not enough neuroscientists in the world to make a dent. Wouldn't it be something if the gaming industry came to the rescue?

		<p>Co-founder and studio director of Media Molecule, the U.K. studio behind the hit PlayStation game “LittleBigPlanet,” Siobhan Reddy has long spoken about the need for gaming to diversify. “We have a duty to make sure that there are women in the industry,” she told the Australian Times in 2013. “It would just help us make better games, more interesting games, more diverse games, new genres, and new stories.” Reddy was Qantas' 2013 “Australian Woman of the Year” and in 2014 was named one of Forbes' “10 Powerful Women in Gaming.”  Reddy and her team are currently working on a sequel to the 2013 mobile platform game “Tearaway,” about a world made entirely of paper. The game won several BAFTA awards in the year of its release. An expanded follow up, called “Tearaway Unfolded,” will be released for the PlayStation 4 later this month.

Pratchett has always spoken publicly about video games' ability to tell powerful, unique stories that shape players' worldview. She was also a powerful voice in the #1ReasonWhy online debate surrounding sexism in video games, coining the sister hashtag #1ReasonToBe.  The campaign featured women's positive experiences working in the game industry in order to encourage more women to choose video games as their career. In support of this sentiment, GDC has hosted a #1ReasonToBe panel supporting female voices in the industry for two years running. Pratchett also dabbles in writing fiction, comic books and screenplays, and is currently co-writing a British television show based on the Discworld fantasy novels written by her father, Terry Pratchett.
