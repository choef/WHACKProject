		<h1>About Us</h1>
			<p>We're a team of first-year students at Wellesley College who, along with our mentor, decided to create this
			page as our project for the Wellesley Hackathon 2015 because we're very passionate about seeing more women in
			tech, and specifically in games, one of the subsets of tech where women are most excluded.</p>

				<p>Daniela Kreimerman loves all her classes equally (though some more equally than others), but has yet to
				find anything she loves more than playing <i>Cards Against Humanity</i> with friends. That's about as far as
				she goes into gaming, too, but #gamergate annoyed her into caring about this topic because she's just a pest
				like that.</p>
