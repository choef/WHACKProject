		<h1>About Us</h1>
			<p>We're a team of first-year students at Wellesley College who, along with our mentor, decided to create this
			page as our project for the Wellesley Hackathon 2015 because we're very passionate about seeing more women in
			tech, and specifically in games, one of the subsets of tech where women are most excluded. The media we consume 
			affects all of us, and if women are poorly represented in media, it contributes to larger patterns of stigma. By
			including more women in the game-making process, we could greatly ameliorte how women are portrayed in games, but
			also how real women who work in the industry are treated by their peers.</p>

				<p>Dorothy had no experience in gaming besides staying in a classroom with a bunch of boys and hearing their maniacal shouting and screaming from playing DOTA. After participating in this project of setting up a website on women in gaming, she learned a lot about gaming culture and would want to contribute on the journey that helps more girls find their passions in gaming. </p>

				<p>Daniela Kreimerman loves all her classes equally (though some more equally than others), but has yet to
				find anything she loves more than playing <i>Cards Against Humanity</i> with friends. That's about as far as
				she goes into gaming, too, but #gamergate annoyed her into caring about this topic because she's just a pest
				like that.</p>
